                  Future Earthâ€™s blueprint is based on a model that was designed by one 
                  of our founders, Maya Minkova, 25 years ago while still a student, for 
                  a safe and sustainable homes project in South African townships. We have 
                  adapted the PATHWAY (power, agriculture, technology, housing, women and youth) 
                  model as the framework that outlines our projects. We believe that women and the 
                  youth, who make up more than half of the society, are critical in unlocking 
                  self-development. The project will target women as homeowners, giving them assets 
                  and credit and therefore power to self-develop. We also emphasize support for SMEs 
                  owned by women and young people to provide services within the community.
